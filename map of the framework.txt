app contains the logic
public contains the static files and an index.php file
.htaccess prevents going to the root directroty of the framework


THE APP FOLDER
it contains six folders and a .htaccess and a bootstrap.php file
six folders are 
1-config  >> defines the db connection and configration of the app
2-controllers >> where the controllers go
3-helpers >> where the helper files go like sessions, flash cards ...
4-libs >> where the heart of our app goes files like 
   Core.php >> which handles the url parameters
   Model.php >> which handles the db 
   Controller >> which handles the Controller logic 

5-models which contains our models 
6-views which contains our views 

in the .htacess file there is a code that prevents the user from acessing this "app" folder directly
and we are going to include all the files in the bootstrap.php 


THE PUBLIC FOLDER

it cotaints folders like js, css, img, index.php and a .htaccess 
1-index.php where we include our bootstrap and a few other things like our core library
2-.htacess where we map everything to the index.php with some apache directives, so when it requests some file and it's not there 
it will go to the index unless it's there it will load the file up
